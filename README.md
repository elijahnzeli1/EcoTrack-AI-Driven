This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## To make this a full-fledged PWA (Progressive Web App):

We've added the next-pwa configuration in next.config.js.
You'll need to create a manifest.json file in the public folder with the appropriate app information.
You should also add appropriate icons in the public folder for various device sizes.

## To further improve the project:

Implement proper error handling and loading states in components and API calls.
Add authentication and authorization (consider using NextAuth.js).
Implement real API endpoints to replace the placeholder fetch calls.
Add more interactive features to the map component, such as filtering and data layers.
Enhance the virtual assistant with more sophisticated AI interactions.
Implement a proper token economy system in the marketplace.
Add data visualization components to better represent environmental impact.
Implement proper SEO optimization using Next.js's built-in features.
Set up unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
